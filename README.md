# HTZ Parse Breakpoints State

A module to parse and evaluate the state of active breakpoints from a JSON-like string 
generated by [JigSass MQ](https://github.com/txhawks/jigsass-tools-mq) and attached to 
the `::after` pseudo element of an element using the CSS `content` property.

See [documentation](https://haaretz.github.io/htz-parse-bps-state) for more info.
